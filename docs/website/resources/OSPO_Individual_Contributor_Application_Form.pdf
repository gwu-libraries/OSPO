Complete applications will be evaluated and must meet a minimum threshold to be 
entered in the lottery:
● Must include at least one meaningful contribution of code or documentation 
addressing existing issues and accepted by the maintainer of an existing 
active Project
● The project you contribute to may be a GW or external project, but our evaluation
committee will verify that the contributions are beneficial and not trivial

Please take care to understand that project maintainers can be extremely busy, so to be
a good open source contributor, follow the codes of conduct and contribution guidelines
and be sure to tackle only existing issues.  E.G. Do not submit a pull request to fix typos.

I certify that this is my original work and that I have properly cited the works of others.
I give permission for my likeness and my work to be used in OSPO marketing materials.
