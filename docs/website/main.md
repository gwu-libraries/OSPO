## Overview
Our team is committed to fostering a culture of networked collaboration, promoting open-source software development, open data, and open access in research and education.  We will support the university community in adoption of open practices to ensure we maximize our impact on a local and global scale to leverage GWUâ€™s research, teaching, and policy expertise.

Core objectives:
