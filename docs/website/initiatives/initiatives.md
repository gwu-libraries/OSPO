# Initiatives
The primary functions of the OSPO are to foster a culture of networked collaboration, promoting open-source software development, open data, and open access in research and education, and to support the university community in adoption of open practices.  

The following initiatives aim to maximize social impact on a local and global scale leveraging GWUâ€™s research, teaching, and policy expertise.

## Open Research Initiative
